    "A Jupyter notebook, a Python interface, mainly consists of two types of cells: Markdown and Code cells. A Code cell is a block of contents that contain snippets of code written in Python Programming Language. A markdown cell is a block of contents that contain text and sometimes image.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress, you may realize the importance of markdown cells while programming with python language. Markdown cells allow you to keep track of what you've done in the Code cells by displaying titles or a brief summary of tasks in a text format (You can add headings, emphasis (bold or italic text), mathematical symbols, bullets and horizontal lines etc). This assignment is meant to guide you to become familiar with markdown language.\n",
